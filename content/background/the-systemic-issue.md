YouTube algorithm is, according to Google itself, a regulation system of the platform. It is used to increase profits in two ways, impacting both the information flow and the type of boosted content. A social, information, and therefore political influence.

##### YT wants to control how the platform is perceived by advertisers, who are not willing to pay to appear on problematic content, which must therefore be penalized.
The influence of advertisers is similar to that of a traditional content publisher, but how much they count, and who matters the most for Google, are unknown factors still to be decoded.
Also, the very definition of “problematic” content raises several issues. The concept itself, _ça va sans dire_, is highly relative and variable depending on the perspective of those who make this classification. It is not even clear which criteria are adopted to reach such definition, nor the actors participating in this process. Human moderators? Ever-changing policies? Artificial intelligence? Or the brands that invest the most? How does the mainstream media affect this process and which are the newspapers and the TV channels that have more weight in this sense? And why?

##### maximize the time captured to the audience
In the digital economy - or at least in the dominant business model of the ICT market – users’ attention is the scarce good par excellence. Content creators and the platforms that host them are constantly struggling to get hold of a slice of this asset. In the case of YouTube, the circulating information is not chosen, nor favored or promoted, on the basis of its quality, accuracy, or beauty. The algorithm prefers the most visceral contents, which ensure viral sharing. The actual indicators that will promote a content to trending topic are rather the time of visualization, the number of interactions generated, the speed of dissemination.

### Even the most reasonable internal regulation established by Google translates into less profits.
For example, stopping to associate ads with high economic value to potentially viral conspiracy videos means cutting a big slice of profit out.

### That’s why we should not expect these concessions from companies themselves, if not as a result of campaigns, debates, analysis, and struggles.
