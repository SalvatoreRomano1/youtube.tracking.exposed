### Work in progress: our Roadmap

1. ☑  Have a browser extension capable of copying the YouTube pages: it is implemented, we still need some help in maintainance [Chrome store,](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/yttrex/kbbgjcgdcibilpahljnlejefcehbljnd) and [Firefox store](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/yttrex/).
2. ☐  Implement a decent statistics collection system
3. ☑  Release a simple API without any interface, to let researchers and developers experiment with the tool
4. ☐  Develop an interface which permits an individual to delete their submission and control data retention policy
5. ☑  Develop functionalities to let adopters play and compare their results.
6. ☐  Develop the [author ](/author)page, to let people compare video selecting by their chosen source.
